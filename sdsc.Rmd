```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
nc = read_sf(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf"))
pts = st_centroid(st_geometry(nc))
xy = st_coordinates(st_centroid(nc$geom))
```

## Data science: the table view

```{r, results='asis'}
cols = c(3,5,9:14)
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(nc)[1:7,cols])
```

## ... with coordinates
```{r, results='asis'}
cols = c(3,5,9:10,16:17)
# xy = st_coordinates((nc$geom))
nc$longitude = xy[,1]
nc$latitude = xy[,2]
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(nc)[1:7,cols])
```

## ... with POINT geometries
```{r, results='asis'}
cols = c(3,5,9:14)
nc$geometry = format(pts)
cols = c(3,5,9:10,ncol(nc))
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(nc)[1:7,cols])
```

## ... with POLYGON geometries
```{r, results='asis'}
cols = c(3,5,9:14)
nc$geometry = format(nc$geom, width = 50)
cols = c(3,5,9:10,ncol(nc))
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(nc)[1:7,cols])
```


## the "shapefile" view

```{r}
plot(nc[c("SID74", "SID79")], key.pos = 4)
st_crs(nc)
```

## Coordinate reference systems

* are the "measurement units" of spatial coordinates
* relate a location to a particular reference ellipsoid ("datum") 
* may describe a 2-D projection

- analysing tables, creating the right table(s), running a ML or recommender algorithm in order to predict the target variable
- now coordinates come in
- what do they mean?

- measurement units
- as opposed to most variables, coordinates form pairs (or triplets)
- without the other(s), single coordinate values loose much of their meaning

- place information is often not summarized sufficiently by a pair of coordinates: one needs to have set of points, a linestring, a set of these, a polygon, a set of these, or some mix: (simple feature geometries)

(go here into spherical geometry as opposed to planar geometry?)
("simple" in simple features, but what does a "straight" line between two points _mean_, on a sphere?)

- if we want to join information spatially, we have many predicates that can be used: intersects, overlaps, covers, touches, ... and more complex can be easily deviced (example: touch along line, not point)

- after joining spatially, what happens to the attributes? if we want to analyse data, _support_ is of importance

- next comes in: time (e.g., movement): linear? cyclic?

- next comes in: field data (raster, data cubes)

- spatial join may involve spatial aggregations:
  I want to have property x for spatial geometries y:
