Title: From Data Science to Spatial Data Science

Description:
Data scientists confronted with spatial data often like to think that
latitude and longitude are just two more features in an already large
feature set. Although this may be fine in certain cases, this talk
will discuss where it might lead to failure or lost opportunities.
It will also discuss the models that spatial statisticians like
to use, and challenges in analysing movement data and large scale
satellite imagery.

Workshop title: An Introduction to Spatial Data Science with R
