ML on spatial data: need to throw in x + y (or long + lat)

 -> their coherence is gone
 -> are solutions rotation/translation invariant?

 IN CASE OF MULTIPOINT/LINE/POLYGON geometry:
 -> dropping shape, size, 
 -> distance, touches, etc relationships are gone
 -> meaning ("size") of long depends on lat
